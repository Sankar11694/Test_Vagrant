In this example, the TestRecentlyPlayedStore class is a subclass of unittest.TestCase, which allows us to define individual test methods. Inside each test method, we create an instance of the RecentlyPlayedStore class and test its methods using assertions from the unittest module.
To run the tests, you can execute the test_recently_played_store.py file directly.
